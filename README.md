# basket-coding-challenge

Created for the Coding-Challenge involved in an application at a company.

# Development Notes
- Developed in VS Code with Dev Container Extension
- Build Maven Project and Execute it (Main.java contains two different Test Cases as stated in the task)

## Notes
# Possible Improvements:
- add better error handling
    - due to time limitations there is some error handling missing
- add dynamic deals
    - deals could be added dynamically with java predicates or similar (was half finished but not completed due to time limitations)
- automatic Deal Discount application
    - currently the discount must be called as if it was a scanned coupon
